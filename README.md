# anomR
Anomaly detection in R.

The goal here is to build a semi-comprehensive, cohesive set of optimized algorithms in base R to perform anomaly detection tasks. The plan is to begin by building common metrics (Euclidean, Gower, Hamming), and using them to build some simple methods (k-means, kNN, clustering SVM), and then moved in to some more advanced approaches (INCONCO, isolation forests).
